Cryptocurrency is a subset of digital currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as crypto-currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. There are various cryptocurrencies including LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, and the currently most popular one Bitcoin. It is the perfect way to make trustless and anonymous transactions since it does not involve any third party - there is no central bank. 

Unlike normal currency, cryptocurrency can be exchanged as fractions. For example, transactions can amount to 0.00007 BTC or even lower.

Many cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can be earned by validating transactions on the network. This process of validation is called "proof of work" and consists of mathematically guessing a random numbers (usually less than a certain determined value or "difficulty") to attempt to match the blockchain's irreversible cryptographic hash function. As more transactions are validated (and rewards for validation are collected) over time, the difficulty of finding the correct hash increases. An increase in the popularity of cryptocurrency mining over the past few years has outpaced the development of the average computational power of a household computer, so in order to mine effectively, one requires a computer (or computers) with especially powerful graphics cards (such as the Nivida GTX 1080) or specialized cryptocurrency mining equipment (such as the Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV). It should also be noted that, because of drawbacks of proof-of-work validation (such as energy inefficiency), some cryptocurrencies are exploring alternative algorithms such as "proof of work".
